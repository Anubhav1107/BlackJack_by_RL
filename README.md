Teaching a machine to play BlackJack
A human can learn anything If someone teaches them rules and few games but what about Machines. Do they have the power to play or think. In this Mini Project by Udacity, I tried
to teach a Agent to play BlackJack by showing the rules and allowing to play a thousand times before it comes to a optimal policy.
